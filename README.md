Tec de Monterrey Data Boot Camp Final Project

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

Airbnb is a internet marketplace to allow any home or deparment owner rentals, It allows you to, for example, rent out your home for a week while youâ€™re away, or rent out your empty looby or garage. One challenge that Airbnb host face is defining the optimal rent price, In many cities or areas renters are presented with a good selection istings and can filter by criteria like price, number of bedrooms, room type, and more.




DATA DESCRIPTION 

Airbnb doesnt provide any source of data to measure prices or marketplaces, but a separate group named Inside Airbnb scrapes and compiles publicly available information about many cities Airbnb's listings from the Airbnb web-site. 
For this project, their data set scraped on July 18, 2021, on the city of Mexico is used. It contains information on all Mexico Airbnb listings that were live on the site on that date.

The data has certain limitations. The most noticeable one is that it scrapes the advertised price rather than the actual price paid by previous customers. More accurate data is available for a fee in sites like AirDNA.

Each row in the data set is a listing available for rental in Airbnb's site for the specific city (observations). The columns describe different characteristics of each listing (features).
The most important features this project will look into are the following:
- Price: nightly price for the rental
